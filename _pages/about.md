My name is Qisen Yang(杨淇森). I entered [Turing Class](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/turingclass_en)( Chu Kochen Honors College ), Zhejiang University in 2019. I am now an undergraduate student at College of Computer Science & Technology, Zhejiang University. Currently I am supervised by [Prof. Yingcai Wu](http://www.ycwu.org) at [ZJUIDG](zjuidg.org). My research interests include Visualization and Human-Computer Interaction, especially how to use visualization techniques to facilitate the process of data fetching and data analysis.

I'm looking for PhD position at 2023fall, you can find my [CV](https://github.com/QS-Yang/QS-Yang.github.io/raw/main/docs/CV.pdf) here.

# 📖 Educations

- *2019.08 - 2023.06*, Undergraduate, Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang Univeristy, Hangzhou. 


# 🔥 News
- *2023.01*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 One paper about gaze-moderated visualization on augmenting sports video was accepted by CHI 2023. We will open source later!
- *2022.07*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 One paper about visualization in argument sports video was accepted by IEEE VIS 2022. My first co-authored paper!

# 💻 Research Experience
- *2022.06 - present* **Undergradute Visiting Research Intern, VisLab, HKUST**

   Advised by Prof. [Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org/). I will work with [Yifang Wang](http://wangyifang.top/about/) to find some interesting interactions between VIS and social computing, especially on U.S. voting history.
