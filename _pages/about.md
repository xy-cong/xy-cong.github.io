Hi! I'm Xiaoyan Cong(丛箫言), a senior undergraduate student (Sep. 2020 - ) at [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/_t1906/wbout/list.psp) & [College of Control Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/cseenglish/main.htm), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), majoring in Robotics Engineering and minoring in Mathematics and “AI+X” Program. During my undergraduate, I am grateful to be advised by [Prof. Xiaowei Zhou](https://www.xzhou.me/), [Prof. Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/), and [Prof. Qixing Huang](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/). 

My research interest lies in the intersection of 3D Computer Vision and
Computer Graphics, particularly including neural rendering, reconstruction, and generative AI, as well as their applications in robotics.

I'm looking for PhD position starting in Fall 2024, you can find my [CV](https://github.com/xy-cong/xy-cong.github.io/raw/main/docs/CV.pdf) here. Feel free to contact me if you have any leads!
